# Unity-Line-Renderer-Extentions
Some useful extensions for the default Unity Line Renderer

There are multiple main features implemented within this extention.
First of all, clamping the LineRenderer (lr) line to a given length.
Second, the color of the lr changing depending on how long the line is, easy usable thanks to the Unity Color Gradient. 
Third, adding the length of the dragged line multiplied towards the other side. 

Check out the examples by importing the .unitypackage, and try playing with the parameters for different results.
